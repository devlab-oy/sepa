This project aims to create an open source implementation of SEPA Financial Messages using Web Services. Project implementation is done in Ruby.

Currently we have support for SEPA Web Services for

* Nordea
* Danske Bank
* OP
* Banks supported by [Samlink](http://www.samlink.fi/ohjelmistopalvelut/)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile

```ruby
gem 'sepafm'
```

And then execute

```bash
$ bundle
```

**Or** install gem with

```bash
$ gem install sepafm
```

And require it in your code

```ruby
require 'sepafm'
```

## Using the Gem

Define parameters hash for client, ie. get Nordea bank statement

```ruby
params = {
  bank: :nordea,
  command: :download_file,
  signing_private_key: "...your signing private key...",
  own_signing_certificate: "...your signing certificate...",
  customer_id: '11111111',
  target_id: '11111111A1',
  file_type: 'TITO',
  file_reference: "11111111A12006030329501800000014"
}
```

Initialize a new instance of the client and pass the params hash

```ruby
client = Sepa::Client.new params
```

Send request to bank

```ruby
response = client.send_request
```

Make sure response is valid

```ruby
response.valid?
```

Get response content

```ruby
response.content
```

## Getting Started

First, you need certificates from your bank. For basic requests you'll need

* Your signing certificate
* Private key for your signing certificate
* Your encryption certificate (Danske Only)
* Private key for your encryption certificate (Danske Only)
* Banks encryption certificate (Danske Only)

You have to get your bank to sign your signing/encryption certificate(s). For this you need to make

* Your signing certificate signing request
* Your encryption certificate signing request (Danske Only)

### Generating CSR

You can generate your certificate signing requests with `openssl`

```bash
openssl req -out encryption.csr -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout encryption.key
openssl req -out signing.csr -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout signing.key
```

 * for Nordea the key is 1024 bits
 * for OP the CSR must be created using the following two parameters (leave all other blank):
  * `C=FI`
  * `CN=1234567890` (your 10-digit customer id)

Enter your information and you should have four files

```
encryption.csr
encryption.key
signing.csr
signing.key
```

### Downloading Nordea and OP Certificates

Define parameters hash for client

```ruby
params = {
  pin: '1234567890',
  bank: :nordea|:op,
  command: :get_certificate,
  customer_id: '11111111',
  environment: 'test',
  signing_csr: "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----
...your signing.csr content...
...line length should be 64 digits...
-----END CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----"
}
```

For OP, pin consists of 16 digits.

Initialize a new instance of the client and pass the params hash

```ruby
client = Sepa::Client.new params
```

Send request to bank

```ruby
response = client.send_request
```

Make sure the response is valid

```ruby
response.valid?
```

Get the certificate from the response and save it in a safe place

```ruby
response.own_signing_certificate
```

### Downloading Danske Bank Certificates

For Danske, `customer_id` consists of 6 characters (`digit` + `letter` + `4 digits`) and `pin` contains 4 alphanumeric characters.

**Bank's certificates**

Define parameters hash for client

```ruby
params = {
  bank: :danske,
  command: :get_bank_certificate,
  customer_id: '360817',
  environment: 'test',
  pin: '1234'
}
```

Initialize a new instance of the client and pass the params hash

```ruby
client = Sepa::Client.new params
```

Send request to bank

```ruby
response = client.send_request
```

Make sure the response is valid

```ruby
puts response.valid?
```

Get the certificates from the response and save them in a safe place

```ruby
# Bank's encryption certificate
puts response.bank_encryption_certificate

# Bank's signing certificate
puts response.bank_signing_certificate

# Bank's root certificate
puts response.bank_root_certificate
```

**Own certificates**

Define parameters hash

``` ruby
params = {
  bank: :danske,
  bank_encryption_certificate: '...banks encryption certificate content from above...',
  command: :create_certificate,
  customer_id: '360817',
  environment: 'test',
  encryption_csr: '...your encryption.csr content ...',
  signing_csr: '...your signing.csr content...',
  pin: '1234'
}
```

Initialize a new instance of the client and pass the params hash

```ruby
client = Sepa::Client.new params
```

Send request to bank

```ruby
response = client.send_request
```

Make sure the response is valid

```ruby
puts response.valid?
```

Get the certificates from the response and save them in a safe place

```ruby
# Own encryption certificate
puts response.own_encryption_certificate

# Own signing certificate
puts response.own_signing_certificate

# CA Certificate used for signing own certificates
puts response.ca_certificate
```
